# dymoweb
WebServer to host a simple web page to print labels

## Introduction

It presents a web server on port 5000 of the localhost and prints labels on a Dymo Label-manager.

I use the excellent (and fast) Perl package https://github.com/Firedrake/dymo-labelmanager by FireDrake (with some local additions of my own to allow for line padding).
